Project Summary: USPS Digit Classification with Perceptron and NCC

This repository contains code for classifying handwritten digits from the USPS (United States Postal Service) dataset using two different methods: Perceptron and Nearest Centroid Classifier (NCC).

Perceptron Classifier:

The Perceptron classifier is trained to classify a specific digit specified by the digits function. The workflow involves loading the dataset, preprocessing to select the desired digit for classification, splitting into training and testing sets, training the Perceptron model, and visualizing the accuracy over iterations. The learned features are also visualized by plotting the weight vector as an image.

Nearest Centroid Classifier (NCC):

The NCC is another classification method employed for digit classification. Similar to the Perceptron approach, the dataset is loaded, preprocessed, split, and trained using the NCC algorithm. The accuracy over iterations and the centroid of the learned features are visualized.

Integration into README:

The README in this repository provides an overview of both methods for digit classification using the USPS dataset. Each method's functionality, workflow, and visualization techniques are described, along with instructions for usage. Users can refer to the README for a comprehensive understanding of the project and how to implement the Perceptron and NCC classifiers for digit classification tasks. Additionally, the README includes instructions on how to generate and save visualizations of accuracy and learned features for both methods.
